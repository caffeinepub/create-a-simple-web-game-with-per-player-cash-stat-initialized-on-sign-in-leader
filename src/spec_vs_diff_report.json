  "summary": "Diff adds a runner asset preloader and new procedural “detailed” render utilities, and updates RunnerCanvas3D to use theme colors and attempt sprite rendering with procedural fallback. However, the required generated image assets (and HUD coin icon update) are not present in the diff, and obstacle procedural rendering appears to use hardcoded colors rather than CSS-variable theme colors.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Add and use generated static sprite/texture assets placed under frontend/public/assets/generated, referenced directly by the frontend, with graceful fallback if assets fail to load.",
      "reason": "Code references images under /assets/generated and adds an asset loader, but the diff does not include any actual image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the requirement to add/place generated assets is not implemented in the provided changes.",
      "evidence": [

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Increase visual detail for track/ground, lane dividers, obstacles, and player using consistent lighting/shading cues and existing theme colors from CSS variables; remain legible in light/dark themes.",
      "reason": "At least the low obstacle procedural renderer uses hardcoded red palette hex values instead of deriving colors from the theme/CSS variables, which conflicts with the requirement to use existing theme colors consistently.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/game/runner/runnerRenderUtils.ts (drawDetailedLowObstacle uses '#ef4444', '#dc2626', '#b91c1c', '#7f1d1d')"

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Update the HUD coin icon asset at /assets/generated/coin-icon.dim_256x256.png to a more detailed version consistent with the in-world coin; keep HUD icon size 32x32 without layout regressions.",
      "reason": "No HUD coin icon asset file addition/replacement is shown, and no HUD-related change is evidenced in the diff summary.",
